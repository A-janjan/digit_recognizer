# digit_recognizer
## Version 0.1.0

Digit detection with python tensorflow and opencv.
> In progress

## Some Description

Basic modules : OpenCV, Tensorflow<br/>
Basic Method for Learning and Predicting: Neural Networks<br/>
Neural Network Architecture: CNN and ZFnet<br/>
Training dataset: MNIST<br/>
Persian Readers can read my primary report about this code which is accessible in Document folder.<br/>

## Test

Before running , execute the following command to be sure:
```
$ pip install -r /path/to/requirements.txt
```

For test code you must run:

```
$ cd test
$ python detector.py --image example.jpeg
```
and for see digits from right to left, you can enter any keyboard buttons to see next. and you can also see percentage of each prediction in command line.<br/>
Note: This commands are written for Unix-based operating systems. But it is easily to test this program in windows.<br/>
Note: ZFnet architecture has not been used in test. but you can see that, in repo.<br/>
